TES block cipher that I did for the course "Cryptography and Information Security" at Warsaw University of Technology
Along the TES ciphering are 4 possible modes of encryption : ECB,CBC,CFB and OFB

I used some code from the following repository : https://gist.github.com/twheys/4e83567942172f8ba85058fae6bfeef5
